I'm a third year Ph.D. student in the Biophysical Sciences, co-advised by [Aaron Dinner](https://dinner-group.uchicago.edu/) and [Arvind Murugan](http://muruganlab.uchicago.edu/) at the University of Chicago. 

I enjoy combining experiments, theory, and computation in order to tackle the most exciting questions in biology. Broadly, my interests are in the physics of protein evolution and machine learning for biology. I am combining experimental directed evolution, automated liquid handling, and pipetting robots to measure protein adaptability at scale. From this data, I will use advanced dimensionality reduction techniques to learn low-dimensional relationships between protein sequence, phenotype, and adaptability.

I did my undergrad at Boston University where I earned a degree in Chemistry: Biochemistry with minors in both Biology and Computer Science. Most of my previous research experience was at Stanford University, where I worked with [Julia Salzman](https://salzmanlab.stanford.edu/) to analyze RNA-sequencing data from COVID positive patients with a statistical splicing algorithm. I also worked with [William Lehman](https://www.bumc.bu.edu/camed/profile/william-lehman/) in the BU School of medicine to predict the effect of point mutations on myosin filaments with molecular dynamics simulations.
