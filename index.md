  ## Hello world
---

I'm a first year Ph.D. student in the Biophysical program at the University of Chicago. I'm interested in modeling biology with computers and finding out what is actually happening to proteins at a structural level. In particular, I would like to be able to use molecular dynamics to explore conformational space and use machine learning methods to speed up simulations. I would love to apply what I will learn to help further our understanding of how we can rationally design molecules (both small and macrocyclic) to be more drug-like and affect target structure in an intentional way.

To me, chemistry and computer science are the most interesting in the context of biological systems and I would love to be able to apply computational chemistry to relevent protein chemistry.
