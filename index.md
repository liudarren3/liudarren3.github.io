I'm a third year Ph.D. student in the Biophysical Sciences, advised by [Aaron Dinner](https://dinner-group.uchicago.edu/) and [Arvind Murugan](http://muruganlab.uchicago.edu/) at the University of Chicago. 

I enjoy combining experiments, theory, and computation in order to tackle the most exciting questions in biology. Broadly, my interests are in the physics of protein evolution and machine learning for biology. I am combining experimental directed evolution, automated liquid handling, and pipetting robots to measure protein adaptability at scale. From this data, I will use advanced dimensionality reduction techniques to learn low-dimensional relationships between protein sequence, phenotype, and adaptability.
